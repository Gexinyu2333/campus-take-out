# campus-take-out
Campus take-out is a software product specially customized for campus restaurants, aimed at improving the operational efficiency of campus catering and the ordering experience of customers. This project aims to build a food delivery platform that integrates management backend and user side mini programs, enabling campus catering dish management, order processing, data analysis, and other functions. At the same time, it provides convenient ordering, payment, and delivery tracking services for consumers with specific identities such as students and faculty on campus. It is a project built on the basis of [itheima's](http://www.itheima.com/) the sky take-out.
Campus take-out adopts a front-end and back-end separation development model. The front-end uses Vue.js framework to build the user interface, and the back-end uses Spring Boot framework to build the service layer. MySQL is used for data storage in the database. The overall system follows the RESTful API design principles to ensure efficient and stable front-end and back-end interaction.
In terms of technology selection, Campus take-out uses multiple technology stacks, including front-end Vue.js+ElementUI+WeChat mini program, back-end Spring Boot+SpringMVC+MyBatis+MySQL, as well as other technologies such as Redis (caching), Nginx (reverse proxy and load balancing), JWT (security authentication), etc. These technologies ensure high performance and scalability of the system, improve system response speed, and implement user authentication and authorization through JWT, ensuring system data security.
